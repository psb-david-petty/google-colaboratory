        "\n",
        "This notebook calculates grading scenarios for students to obtain a passing grade for 2019-2020 S2.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Goals\n",
        "\n",
        "- Students must be able to pass (both S2 and for the year), regardless of their grade for Q3, if they do the work for Q4.\n",
        "- Students need only achieve [`70%` COMPLETION](http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/uploads/8/0/1/5/801512/9april_student_p_f_guidelines.pdf) of the work to pass.\n",
        "- The Q3 work assigned *prior* to the 2020/03/13 shutdown must somehow equitably factor into their S2 grade &mdash; especially for semester courses.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "My proposed strategy for Q4 grading is:\n",
        "\n",
        "- pick the lowest Q3 grade of any of my students (`40%`);\n",
        "- use a fixed number of assignments (`12`); \n",
        "- calculate the points / assignment from the calculations below (`5`); and\n",
        "- adjust the [Canvas](https://brookline.instructure.com/) weighting for Q3 / Q4 to `30%` / `70%`. \n",
        "\n",
        "This strategy ensures (a) every student can pass S2 and (b) students need only complete a *passable* amount of Q4 work to pass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Equitability cuts both ways. It should include students who did *little* work and students who did *all* work during Q3 in-person classes completing a *passable* amount of Q4 work to pass.\n",
        "\n",
        "**This may not be in concert with mandated BHS-wide, cross-departmental guidelines.** (Is it?)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Notebook code\n",
        "\n",
        "My strategy came out of the results of this notebook, which uses the following parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `total` is `100` points (change this value to change the denominator)\n",
        "- `threshold` is `70` points (`70%` of `total` &mdash; change this value to change the numerator and the threshold percentage)\n",
        "- `q3min` is the lowest Q3 grade (out of `total` points) for which the student can still pass S2\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on these parameters, this notebook calculates the following values:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `N` is the number of assignments &mdash; assuming a fixed value for each assignment\n",
        "- `points` is the number of points / assignment &mdash; assuming a fixed value for each assignment\n",
        "- `q3` is the minimum passing Q3 grade &mdash; under three scenarios:\n",
        " - Q3 grade was `q3min`\n",
        " - Q3 grade was `70%`\n",
        " - Q3 grade was `100%`\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The `points` are calculated such that, even if the Q3 grade is `q3min`, students can still pass the semester by completing *all* the remaining assignments &mdash; though students with a Q3 grade of `100%` need only complete something more than half the remaining assignments to pass. **Students with a Q3 grade below `q3min` cannot pass S2.** The requirement that *any* student should be able to pass S2, *regardless of their Q3 grade*, implies this model's assumption of a 30 / 70 split on the quarters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scenarios are calculated for Q3 grades of `0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%` and `8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14` remaining assignments.\n",
        "\n",
        "All 123 scenarios are listed below for completeness."
